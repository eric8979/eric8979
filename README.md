<h1> 🐋 Hi! I'm Eric Whale. </h1>


<p>I am a Computer Engineering student. I do personal projects and post them on GitHub. I love learning new things. I haven't decided on a field to focus on yet, but since I have many ideas that require a website/app, I have a skill set of a full-stack developer (specifics down below). </p>
