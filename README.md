# 🐋 Welcome to Eric Whale's page

## 😎 Bio

I am a University Student major in Computer Engineering. I do personal projects and post them on GitHub. I love learning new things, so it's always fun to learn new languages and frameworks for my projects. I haven't decided on a field to focus on yet, but since I have many ideas that require a website/app, I have a skill set of a full-stack developer (specifics down below). <br>
I dream of a utopia, and I believe that by collective contemplation, we will get closer.
